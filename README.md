# Suicide Among Veterans in the United States
The motivation behind this group project was to use data to answer a series questions surrounding suicides among Veterans in the United States.  What we hope to accomplish from this project was to be able to share our foundings in order to create awareness that will help expand the network of support for veterans.

## Research Questions: 
* What is the rate of veteran suicides and how does that compare to non-veterans?
* Which states have the most veterans' death due to suicide and what is the total availability of Veteran Affairs (VA) medical centers in those high risk states?
* Which veteran age group(s) have the highest rate of suicide?
* Do male veterans have a higer rate of suicide than female veterans or vice versa?
* Is there a trend occurring with suicide related deaths among veterans and if there is one, is it increasing or decreasing?
